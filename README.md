-  <strong>Link to website:<strong> `https://anet-847ad.firebaseapp.com`

# Design Document
The Website's name is "My Academic Network", "ANET". It is an interactive application that helps students connect with other students based on professional and academic interests. It allows them to participate in an open cyber space where learning and the development of multidisciplinary projects takes place. It helps new students navigate the university system with experiences shared by other peers.

## Topic
The goal of the application is to boost collaborative learning across different departments at TC, and facilitate networking opportunities among students.

*Which broader field(s) does this site apply to?*
The site could be used by all current students at Columbia University. This application could become the bridge that facilitates interaction and collaborative work within a university across multiple academic disciplines.

## Problem
*What is the problem you're trying to solve?*
There’s an MyTC App that has general info about News related with the school, campaigns for raising money, important numbers and directory, maps, and info about the shuttle. When you login, you have more specifics about your classes, grades, etc. But this App doesn’t offer any space for networking and connecting with other students.

## Target Audience
*Who is your target audience? Describe in detail*
New Students looking for guidance from less intimidating sources like peers. Students looking to collaborate on multidisciplinary projects. Students looking to network with other students within their academic department or other students in other programs for professional purposes.  

### User Stories
Harry Potter:
He is a 25 year old that was working as a world history teacher at public school in New Jersey. Harry decided it was time to go for his masters degree and applied at Teachers College in the department of International and Transcultural Studies.  He is starting in the fall, the International Educational Development program. He is a little nervous because he does not know anyone at the college and would like to get some guidance from experienced students at his program.

Hermione Granger:
She is a 30 year old student currently attending her second year at Teachers College. Hermione is pursuing a Masters degree in Elementary Inclusive Education at the Department of Curriculum & Teaching. She is currently developing a Curriculum specially designed for children with ADHD. She would like to use technology to implement different learning methods for these children. She would also like to get research that backs her strategies. She knows that there are other departments within TC, but do not know who to ask and even if other students are interested in working with her in this project.

Ron Weasley:
He is a 33 year old student. He is in the psychology department. He wants to network with students in his department and the leadership and education Policy department because he wants to change careers and is looking for students that are currently working or have worked in education policy or government and could give him some insight and maybe a contact to get a job.

## Strategy

### Site Objectives:
*What do we want to get out of the site?*
We want to provide users with an enhanced Teachers College Academic experience by exponentially increasing their chances for collaborative learning and peer interaction.

### Success Metrics
*Outline how you will check that the goals for your site have been met*
Is the product delivering value to our specific users? learn how early adopters are approaching the product (user’s behavior), if they satisfied with its key features, what else they would like to be incorporated.
- measure the activation rate of new users.
- analyze user’s behavior (customer flows)
- in-person users interviews
- Number of new interdepartmental projects being started as a result of interactions at the site.


## Scope
Functional and Content Specifications
In terms of our MVP: What are the minimum features that we have to integrate to test our product.   
Features: academic/professional profile, Instant Messaging system, browser of past collaborative projects and new projects. This is a social application and not a content application. Basically, the content will be provided by users for the most part, except for the general information of the site and rules of engagement.


## Structure
Interaction design and information architecture
The users will upload the landing page where we are going to present the logo, a navigation bar at the top and bottom of the page, A presentation with some media and the main services offered by ANET, then a brief ABOUT description followed by some testimonials, media, and the preview of projects and events. At the end we will place a contact us.

We were thinking of the possibility of signing up using Linkedin as a method for user authentication, so that student's professional profile will be filled out automatically. After importing the information from their Linkedin profile, they will be able to customize their profile even more by adding academic interests and goals. After the user has successfully signed in, he/she can check if there are any messages waiting for him/her from current contacts. User will be able to see if there are new requests to connect from other students. Additionally, they will be able to search topics of interest or search for other users that match their academic interests.

## Skeleton
Interface, navigation, information design

The information will be presented in cascade. As you scroll down you will discover more and more about ANET, but again, this will be only a preview to catch users' attention and lit their desire to sign-up. Nevertheless, if the user wants to learn more about a particular section of the homepage, he can click on it and more information will be provided. The nav bars also will allow the user to navigate between pages and and externally to other social media.

The font we want to be the same, although identifying titles and headers according to importance and hierarchical order. The main colors used will be blue, white and black mainly because blue is the color that defines TC Columbia's identity. The images used will point to the collaborative work, students working together, multidisciplinary teams.

Users will be able to see their profile and academic interests with a click of a button. They can also search for other users by name or by department. In the future, we can create a matching profile tool to match user's interests. Users will be able to click their current contact's icon and be directed to their profiles where instant messaging will be an option.

## Third Party Video Production & Pictures

We are planning to use a third party platform for the purposes of User Authentication (LinkedIn).
